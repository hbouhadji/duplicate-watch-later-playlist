# duplicate watch later playlist

This is a one shot project entirely vibe coded with Codex to move all the 5000 videos from my youtube watch later playlist to another one so I can keep adding new video to it. 

This is using cookies from my browser Brave so you may need some adjustments for others chromium browsers.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.8. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
